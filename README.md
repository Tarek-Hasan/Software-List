# Software & Games List
Lists of softwares & games used by me or i would prefer to use. It includes both opensource and free software.
Here are the methods I use to choose my software stack.
- I prefer one software for single purpose. So I choose a software which offers more features than other softwares form same category.
- I only use multiple software for similar purpose if they have useful features unique to them.
- I prefer GUI over CLI.
- Only use CLI when there is no GUI app. And GUI is not more complicated than CLI. Yes, there are some genius developers who accomplished this seemingly impossible job.
- From multiple GUI software I choose more user friendily and nice looking one.

Suggesions are welcome.
